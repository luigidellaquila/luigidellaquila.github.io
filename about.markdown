This website is not my resume.

Probably not even a blog.

You'll find here random thoughts, announcements, technical content. Rants eventually.

Please don't expect consistency or continuity. See it more as a public brainstorming.

My intention is to publish content in English, but I could decide to write something in Italian every now and then.
